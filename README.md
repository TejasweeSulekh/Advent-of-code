# üéÑ Advent of code üõ∑‚ú®‚ú®
This is a personal repository which stores my solutions for AOC. I plan on solving all the years AOC .

## üíª About Advent of Code 
[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent Calendar of programming puzzles for a variety of skill set and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. One programming puzzle a day is released from 1st
to 25th December, divided in two parts (the second of which is unlocked after
solving the first). Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/), and is
100% free. If you like Advent Of Code and want to support its creator, you can
donate to him [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/support). If you want to hang out with other fellow
coders, discuss about puzzles and solutions, or just have a look around, you can
join the official subreddit: [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/)

## üí° Current Plan
The main reason for doing this is one to see the christmas tree light up üòä

Though I would like to complete the solutions for all the years to practice and expand my skill levels. Along with this I want to try assigning year its programming language as there are some languages that I would love to be more familiar with. I will keep updating the table below accordingly with whichever language I decide for any year. 

| Year | Programming Language |
|------|----------------------|
| 2015 | tbd                  |
| 2016 | tbd                  |
| 2017 | tbd                  |
| 2018 | tbd                  |
| 2019 | tbd                  |
| 2020 | tbd                  |
| 2021 | tbd                  |

*tbd - to be decided

The progress made so far has been visualized for easy book keeping by the banners added below. An idea I got from [wermos](https://github.com/wermos/advent-of-code). Here, overall progress considers the years I have started only.

## üóíÔ∏è About this repository
I got to know of `Advent-of-code` in 2023 and participating in 2024. In this repository you will find my solutions and walkthrough (to be added) for the puzzles as well as other miscellaneus stuff like helper scripts or other visualizations.

**In each year's directory** you will find:
Day by day separation of solutions for each day's puzzle
- `README.md`: Containing an in depth walkthrough of my solution along with the data structure and algorithms used
- `Part_1.ext` or `Part_2.ext`: For each day there are two puzzles given the same input, here these will be the files containing the solution for the puzzle. While `.ext` will be the extension for the corresponding language that I decide to use for that year like `.cpp` for 2024
- `/lib`: small library or utilities that I make for the puzzle if there is any reccuring concept in the problems will be in this directory
- `/misc`: if there is anything else interesting or relevant will be stored in this directory
